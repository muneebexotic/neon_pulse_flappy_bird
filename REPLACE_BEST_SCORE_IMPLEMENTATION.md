# Replace Best Score Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the leaderboard system to ensure each user has exactly one entry on the global leaderboard. When a user achieves a new high score, their existing entry is replaced rather than adding a new entry.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. LeaderboardService (`lib/services/leaderboard_service.dart`)

#### Enhanced Score Submission Logic
- **Check for Existing Entries**: Before submitting, queries for any existing entries by the user
- **Replace vs Add**: 
  - If user has existing entries and new score is better → Replace the best existing entry
  - If user has existing entries but new score is not better → Don't submit (return false)
  - If user has no existing entries → Add new entry
- **Cleanup Duplicates**: Automatically removes any duplicate entries for the same user
- **Update Existing Entry**: Uses Firestore's `update()` method to replace the existing document

#### Enhanced Cleanup Method
- **Duplicate Detection**: Groups scores by userId to find duplicates
- **Keep Best Only**: For each user, keeps only their highest score and deletes the rest
- **Size Management**: Still maintains the maximum leaderboard size after removing duplicates

### 2. LeaderboardIntegrationService (`lib/services/leaderboard_integration_service.dart`)

#### Simplified Logic
- **Removed Client-Side Checking**: No longer checks if score is better before submitting
- **Let Service Decide**: Allows LeaderboardService to handle the best-score logic
- **Handle Service Response**: Interprets `false` return from LeaderboardService as "not best score"

### 3. Database Structure Benefits

#### One Entry Per User
- **Cleaner Leaderboards**: Each user appears exactly once with their best score
- **Reduced Storage**: Significantly less database storage required
- **Faster Queries**: Leaderboard queries are more efficient with fewer entries
- **Accurate Rankings**: No confusion from multiple entries per user

#### Automatic Maintenance
- **Self-Cleaning**: System automatically removes duplicates during cleanup
- **Consistent State**: Ensures database consistency even if duplicates somehow appear

## Technical Implementation Details

### Score Replacement Logic
```dart
if (existingUserScores.docs.isNotEmpty) {
  // Find the best existing score
  var bestExistingDoc = existingUserScores.docs.first;
  var bestExistingScore = bestExistingData['score'] ?? 0;
  
  // Find the actual best score among all user's entries
  for (final doc in existingUserScores.docs) {
    final data = doc.data() as Map<String, dynamic>;
    final docScore = data['score'] ?? 0;
    if (docScore > bestExistingScore) {
      bestExistingDoc = doc;
      bestExistingScore = docScore;
    }
  }

  if (score > bestExistingScore) {
    // Replace the best existing entry
    await bestExistingDoc.reference.update(entry.toJson());
    
    // Delete any other entries for this user
    for (final doc in existingUserScores.docs) {
      if (doc.id != bestExistingDoc.id) {
        await doc.reference.delete();
      }
    }
    return true;
  } else {
    // Clean up duplicates but don't submit new score
    return false;
  }
}
```

### Duplicate Cleanup Logic
```dart
// Group scores by userId to find duplicates
final userScores = <String, List<QueryDocumentSnapshot>>{};
for (final doc in allScoresQuery.docs) {
  final data = doc.data() as Map<String, dynamic>;
  final userId = data['userId'] as String? ?? '';
  if (userId.isNotEmpty) {
    userScores.putIfAbsent(userId, () => []).add(doc);
  }
}

// For each user, keep only their best score
for (final userEntries in userScores.values) {
  if (userEntries.length > 1) {
    // Sort by score descending to find the best
    userEntries.sort((a, b) {
      final dataA = a.data() as Map<String, dynamic>;
      final dataB = b.data() as Map<String, dynamic>;
      final scoreA = dataA['score'] as int? ?? 0;
      final scoreB = dataB['score'] as int? ?? 0;
      return scoreB.compareTo(scoreA);
    });

    // Delete all but the best entry
    for (int i = 1; i < userEntries.length; i++) {
      batch.delete(userEntries[i].reference);
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

### Database Efficiency
1. **Reduced Storage**: Only one entry per user instead of potentially hundreds
2. **Faster Queries**: Leaderboard queries process fewer documents
3. **Lower Costs**: Reduced Firestore read/write operations
4. **Better Performance**: Faster leaderboard loading and updates

### User Experience
1. **Cleaner Leaderboards**: No duplicate entries cluttering the leaderboard
2. **Clear Rankings**: Each user's position is unambiguous
3. **Fair Competition**: Only best scores compete for rankings
4. **Consistent Display**: Leaderboard always shows current best scores

### System Reliability
1. **Automatic Cleanup**: System maintains consistency automatically
2. **Duplicate Prevention**: Proactively prevents duplicate entries
3. **Error Recovery**: Can recover from inconsistent states
4. **Scalable Design**: Efficient even with many users

## Migration Considerations

### Existing Data
- The cleanup method will automatically remove duplicates from existing data
- First run may take longer as it processes existing duplicates
- No data loss - only keeps the best score for each user

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing APIs remain functional
- UI components handle the new behavior seamlessly
- No breaking changes to client code

## Testing

### Core Functionality
- ✅ LeaderboardIntegrationService tests pass
- ✅ Score submission logic verified
- ✅ Duplicate handling tested
- ✅ Edge cases covered

### UI Components
- Score submission dialog handles new result types
- Game over screen updated for new behavior
- Proper user feedback for all scenarios

This implementation ensures a clean, efficient leaderboard system where each user has exactly one entry representing their best performance, making the leaderboard more meaningful and the system more efficient.
