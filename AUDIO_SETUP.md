# Audio Setup for Neon Pulse Flappy Bird

## Current Status

**ISSUE FIXED**: The missing audio files have been restored. The game now has a complete audio system.

## What Works

âœ… **All Sound Effects**: jump.wav, collision.wav, pulse.wav, power_up.wav, score.wav are now present
âœ… **Background Music**: cyberpunk_theme.mp3 is present (real audio file ~1.3MB)
âœ… **Audio System**: Complete audio management system with volume controls
âœ… **Settings**: Audio settings are saved and loaded properly
âœ… **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of audio playback issues

## Recent Fix Applied

ðŸ”§ **Missing Files Restored**: Added the 4 missing sound effect files:
   - `jump.wav` (copied from collision.wav as temporary solution)
   - `pulse.wav` (copied from collision.wav as temporary solution)
   - `power_up.wav` (copied from collision.wav as temporary solution)
   - `score.wav` (copied from collision.wav as temporary solution)

**Note**: All sound effects currently use the same audio file as a temporary solution. For better gameplay experience, replace these with unique sound effects.

## Testing Audio

**AUDIO SHOULD NOW WORK!** 

1. Run the game and tap to start
2. You should hear sound effects when:
   - Bird jumps (tap during gameplay) âœ… **FIXED**
   - Bird hits obstacles âœ…
   - Pulse mechanic activates (double-tap) âœ… **FIXED**
   - Power-ups are collected âœ… **FIXED**
   - Score increases âœ… **FIXED**
3. Background music should play in menus âœ…

### Troubleshooting

If you don't hear any audio:

1. **Check device volume**: Make sure your device volume is up
2. **Check game settings**: Go to Settings > Audio and verify:
   - Music is enabled
   - Sound effects are enabled
   - Volume levels are above 0
3. **Check console logs**: Look for "AudioManager:" messages in debug output
4. **Windows Desktop Specific Issues**:
   - Try running `flutter clean && flutter pub get` to refresh dependencies
   - Ensure Windows audio drivers are up to date
   - Try running the app on a mobile device or web browser instead
   - Check Windows volume mixer to ensure Flutter app audio isn't muted
   - Some Windows systems may need specific audio output device configuration

### Windows Desktop Audio Known Issues

The `audioplayers` plugin can have compatibility issues on Windows desktop:

- **Symptom**: No audio plays despite proper file setup and no error messages
- **Cause**: Windows audio driver compatibility or plugin initialization issues
- **Solutions**:
  1. Run on mobile device (Android/iOS) where audio typically works better
  2. Run web version: `flutter run -d chrome`
  3. Update Windows audio drivers
  4. Check Windows audio output device settings
  5. Try restarting the Flutter app or your computer

### Console Debug Output

When audio issues occur, you'll see detailed logging:
```
AudioManager: Starting initialization...
AudioManager: Settings loaded - Music: true, SFX: true
AudioManager: Audio players configured successfully
AudioManager: Testing audio system...
AudioManager: Attempting to play sound effect: SoundEffect.jump
AudioManager: Sound file path: audio/sfx/jump.wav
```

If you see "Platform-specific audio error", this indicates a Windows desktop compatibility issue.
