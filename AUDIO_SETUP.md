# Audio Setup for Neon Pulse Flappy Bird

## Current Status

The game is currently set up with a complete audio system, but the background music file is a placeholder.

## What Works

✅ **Some Sound Effects**: jump.wav, collision.wav, pulse.wav, power_up.wav are working
✅ **Audio System**: Complete audio management system with volume controls
✅ **Beat Detection**: Fallback beat generation for gameplay synchronization
✅ **Settings**: Audio settings are saved and loaded properly
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing audio files

## What Needs Audio Files

❌ **Background Music**: The file `assets/audio/music/cyberpunk_theme.mp3` is currently a text placeholder
❌ **Score Sound**: The file `assets/audio/sfx/score.wav` is currently a text placeholder

## How to Add Real Audio

### Background Music

1. Replace `assets/audio/music/cyberpunk_theme.mp3` with a real MP3 file
2. The file should be:
   - Cyberpunk/electronic music style
   - Loopable (seamless when repeated)
   - Around 128 BPM for optimal beat synchronization
   - Compressed to reasonable file size (< 5MB recommended)

### Missing Sound Effects

1. Replace `assets/audio/sfx/score.wav` with a real WAV file
2. The file should be:
   - Short (< 1 second)
   - Pleasant "ding" or "chime" sound for scoring
   - WAV format for best compatibility

### Testing Audio

1. Run the game and tap to start
2. You should hear sound effects when:
   - Bird jumps (tap during gameplay) ✅
   - Bird hits obstacles ✅
   - Pulse mechanic activates (double-tap) ✅
   - Power-ups are collected ✅
   - Score increases ❌ (placeholder file)

### Troubleshooting

If you don't hear any audio:

1. **Check device volume**: Make sure your device volume is up
2. **Check game settings**: Go to Settings > Audio and verify:
   - Music is enabled
   - Sound effects are enabled
   - Volume levels are above 0
3. **Check console logs**: Look for "AudioManager:" messages in debug output
