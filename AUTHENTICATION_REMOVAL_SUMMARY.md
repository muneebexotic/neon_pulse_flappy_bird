# Authentication Removal Summary

## Files Removed
- `lib/services/auth_service.dart` - Authentication service with Firebase and Google Sign-In
- `lib/ui/screens/auth_screen.dart` - Authentication screen with sign-in options
- `lib/ui/screens/user_profile_screen.dart` - User profile management screen
- `lib/ui/simple_app.dart` - Simple app wrapper for auth testing
- `lib/firebase_options.dart` - Firebase configuration

- `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` - Firebase setup documentation
- `QUICK_START_AUTH.md` - Authentication quick start guide

## Files Modified
- `lib/models/user.dart` - Completely rewritten to use simple `GamePlayer` model instead of `GameUser` with authentication
- `lib/ui/app.dart` - Added main menu route, removed auth dependencies

## Key Changes
1. **User Model**: Replaced complex `GameUser` with authentication state with simple `GamePlayer` for local game statistics
2. **Navigation**: App now goes directly from splash screen to main menu (no auth screen)
3. **Dependencies**: No Firebase, Google Sign-In, or authentication dependencies remain
4. **Data Storage**: Uses local storage only (SharedPreferences) instead of Firestore

## What Remains
- Complete game functionality
- Local high scores and statistics
- Settings and customization
- All game mechanics and features
- Local data persistence

## Benefits
- Simplified codebase
- No external dependencies for user management
- Faster app startup (no auth checks)
- No privacy concerns with user data
- Easier deployment (no Firebase setup required)
- Reduced app size and complexity

The game is now a fully offline experience with local data storage only.
