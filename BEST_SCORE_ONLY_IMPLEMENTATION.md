# Best Score Only Implementation Summary

## Overview
Modified the leaderboard system to only submit a user's best score to the global leaderboard, rather than submitting every score they achieve.

## Changes Made

### 1. LeaderboardIntegrationService (`lib/services/leaderboard_integration_service.dart`)

#### New ScoreSubmissionResult Type
- Added `notBestScore` to the `ScoreSubmissionResult` enum to indicate when a score wasn't submitted because it's not the user's best

#### Enhanced Score Submission Logic
- Added `_shouldSubmitScore()` method that checks if the current score is better than the user's existing best score on the leaderboard
- Modified `submitScore()` to only submit scores that are better than the user's current best
- Updated queued score processing to also respect the "best score only" rule
- Enhanced `_queueScore()` to remove lower scores from the queue when a better score is queued

#### Key Features
- **First-time submission**: If user has no scores on leaderboard, any score is submitted
- **Best score check**: Only submits if new score > current best score on leaderboard
- **Offline queue optimization**: Removes lower queued scores when better scores are added
- **Graceful fallback**: If unable to check existing scores, defaults to submitting (to avoid losing scores)

### 2. Score Submission Dialog (`lib/ui/components/score_submission_dialog.dart`)

#### New Result Handling
- Added case for `ScoreSubmissionResult.notBestScore` in `_getStatusConfig()`
- Shows appropriate message: "This score was not submitted because you already have a better score on the leaderboard"
- Uses grey color and info icon for this status

### 3. Game Over Screen (`lib/ui/screens/game_over_screen.dart`)

#### UI Updates
- Updated `_getStatusColor()` to handle `notBestScore` result type
- Modified status button logic to not show status button for `notBestScore` (since it's not an error condition)

### 4. Tests

#### Added Test Cases
- Added test for `notBestScore` result in score submission dialog test
- Added test for best score validation in leaderboard integration service test
- All existing tests continue to pass

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Database Load**: Only stores each user's best score instead of all scores
2. **Cleaner Leaderboards**: No duplicate entries from the same user with lower scores
3. **Better User Experience**: Users understand that only their best performance counts
4. **Efficient Offline Handling**: Queued scores are optimized to only keep the best scores
5. **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality remains intact

## Technical Implementation Details

### Score Comparison Logic
```dart
// Only submit if new score is better than current best
final shouldSubmit = await _shouldSubmitScore(user.uid!, score, gameMode);
if (!shouldSubmit) {
  return ScoreSubmissionResult.notBestScore;
}
```

### Offline Queue Optimization
```dart
// Remove any existing queued scores that are lower than the new score
queuedScores.removeWhere((existingScore) => 
  existingScore.userId == user.uid! && 
  existingScore.gameMode == gameMode && 
  existingScore.score < score
);
```

### Leaderboard Query
```dart
// Get user's current best score from leaderboard
final leaderboardData = await LeaderboardService.getLeaderboard(
  gameMode: gameMode,
  limit: 1,
  userId: userId,
);
```

## Error Handling

- **Network failures**: Falls back to submitting to avoid losing potentially good scores
- **Query failures**: Defaults to submitting for safety
- **Authentication issues**: Maintains existing behavior
- **Invalid scores**: Continues to reject invalid scores as before

## User Feedback

- **Success**: "Score submitted successfully" (only for best scores)
- **Not best**: "Score not submitted - you already have a better score" (informational, not an error)
- **Queued**: "Score queued for submission when online" (for offline scenarios)
- **Failed**: Existing error handling remains unchanged
