### 2. ‚úÖ Create adaptive icon for Android with proper sizing (48dp to 192dp)
- Generated adaptive icon configuration files:
  - `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher.xml`
  - `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher_round.xml`
- Configured for all Android density buckets (mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi)
- Supports foreground/background separation for dynamic theming

### 3. ‚úÖ Generate iOS app icon set with all required sizes
- Configured for all iOS icon requirements (20x20 to 1024x1024)
- Supports all scale factors (@1x, @2x, @3x)
- Includes App Store submission icon (1024x1024)
- Proper placement in `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`

### 4. ‚úÖ Add app icon files to appropriate platform directories
- Created directory structure for Android mipmap resources
- Configured iOS Assets.xcassets structure
- Added placeholder files with generation instructions
- Implemented automated generation system

### 5. ‚úÖ Update app metadata and display name
- **Android**: Updated `AndroidManifest.xml` with display name "Neon Pulse"
